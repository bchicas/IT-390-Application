          <h3>The Hunger Games</h3>
          <p>Suzanne Collins</p>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            Winning means fame and fortune. Losing means certain death. The
            Hunger Games have begun. . . . In the ruins of a place once known as
            North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded
            by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and
            keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and
            one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in
            the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.
            Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence
            when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But
            Katniss has been close to dead before-and survival, for her, is
            second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender.
            But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that
            weigh survival against humanity and life against love.
